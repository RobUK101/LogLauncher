LogLauncher is designed to make working with log files easier. No need to have multiple File Explorer windows open, to type UNC paths, makes monitoring log activity a breeze.

Built upon .Net 4.0, written using C# and Visual Studio 2015.

The tool is extensible, you can add additional locations to scan, it is not restricted to .LOG extensions (you can specify file extensions to include).

Use this to view ConfigMgr logs, or any log format that is human readable. 

Visited locations are retained making it easy to return to regular log locations.
